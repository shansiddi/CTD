Access CTD project code by unzipping CTD.7z. Open main.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook to run code which conducts data analysis. Data for project downloaded from Ocean Observatories Initiative (OOI). CTD is a conductivity, temperature, and pressure probe which dives into the ocean while taking measurements. OOI is an open source data-set which includes a vast library of CTD data. Data for this project came from the Oregon coast from Coastal Endurance and the Cabled Array. 24 hours worth of data was chosen for download as csv files in Winter and Summer for each CTD available on the two observatories. For each profiler the number of dives, speed of sound profile for each dive, as well as average speed of sound profile were computed. 

Plotting number of dives per day for shallow and deep profilers revealed that fewer dives are conducted on a given day for deep profilers. Fewer deep dives are advisable to protect equipment from great stresses as well as to keep costs low. CTD data is generally expensive deep dives even more so than shallow ones. See figure 2 for comparison between deep and shallow dives per day.
